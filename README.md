# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
This HR analytics Power BI project is aimed at providing HR managers and business leaders with a comprehensive way to analyze and monitor employee data and make data-driven decisions related to employee retention, development, and recruitment.

1. Data Storytelling using the Power BI dashboard showing the factors responsible for employee attrition.
2. Analyzing the employee attrition and retention factors for an organization.
3. Dashboard displaying attrition trends and correlations with demographics.

Note: The PowerBI online publishing link isn't available right now because of subscription issues. I'll add that online link soon, so anyone can open it and interact with it.
